General Design Notes

[Tarp forward cover](# tarp-forward-cover)

To make the hull more rigid, a [1/4'' plywood floor](#plywood-floor) is loosely installed, and 1x2 side and lateral supports are firmly mounted to the gunwale area, at time of set-up.

The tarp end covers are permanently taped to the sides and ends of the hull, reducing any flexing that may occur. Futher, they also assist in preventing water from splahing into the boat. Also, a [transom support](#transom support)
should be implemented for heavier occupants, see note.


Note: For heavier loads(parents), it will be necessary to tape, or screw, a 1x2 wood strip along the transom
top edge, for additional support. See view below
